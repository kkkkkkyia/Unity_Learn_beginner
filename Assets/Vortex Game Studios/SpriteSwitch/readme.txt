Hello and thanks for have purchased the Sprite Switch plugin for Unity!

With this plugin you can switch the animated sprites textures like magic!
You didn't need to create lots of animations and animators for each skins,
because it is a pain -_-' I know that! I did something like this on our game.

But now it easy :D
To know how use this plugin check the sample folder, it have two scenes that
show how to use the plugin using the inspector and by code (C#).

There a very nice YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wQN_Nhwyik.
On this video you can see step-by-step how create your first skinnable sprite :)
